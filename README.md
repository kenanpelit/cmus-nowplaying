cmus-nowplaying
===============

Now Playing scripts for Cmus. See below for how to use + what each file does. All fonts+colors depend on your terminal configuration.

! Note ! If you are using a tiling window manager, then feh may display in fullscreen. Disable this feature in your window manager config and the album art will align itself. Floating window managers shouldn't have to worry about this.
