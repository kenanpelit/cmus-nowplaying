===============

Now Playing scripts for Cmus. See below for how to use + what each file does. All fonts+colors depend on your terminal configuration. ! Note ! If you are using a tiling window manager, then feh may display in fullscreen. Disable this and the album art will align itself. Floating window managers shouldn't have to worry about this.
